Issues you might get:
when you use the official minecraft launcher you might get a error with when it tries to download assets the jar is already downloaded with assets so idk why it wants to download it, to fix this unplug your ethernet cable/disconnect from wi-fi if you want to use official launcher
or use a better launcher like multimc or betacraft
